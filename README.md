# 🧠 LeetCode Solutions & DSA Practice

Welcome to my repository of LeetCode solutions! This project is a collection of my solutions to various algorithmic problems, created to improve my understanding of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**.

I use this repository to track my daily progress, refine my problem-solving skills, and prepare for technical interviews.

## 🛠️ Languages Used

My primary languages for solving problems are **Python** and **JavaScript**, allowing me to practice both backend logic and frontend-related algorithms.

## 📂 Repository Structure

This repository is automatically managed by a browser extension (like [LeetHub v2](https://github.com/arunim-io/leethub-v2)).

Each problem is located in its own dedicated folder, which typically contains:
1.  **Solution Code:** The actual code file (e.g., `.py`, `.js`, `.cpp`) with my solution.
2.  **Problem README:** A markdown file containing the full problem description, examples, and constraints from LeetCode.

This structure makes it easy to navigate and review specific problems and their corresponding solutions.

## 🚀 Goal & Philosophy

My goal is not just to solve the problem but to understand the underlying concepts. For many problems, I aim to:
- Start with a brute-force approach to understand the core logic.
- Optimize the solution for better **Time and Space Complexity**.
- Write clean, readable, and well-commented code.
